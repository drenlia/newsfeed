2. **Scroll to Bottom**: Navigate to the "Import/Export" section at the bottom of the Settings page
3. **Click "Export Configuration"**: This downloads a backup file named `newsfeed-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

**What Gets Exported:**
- All your custom tabs and their names
- All RSS feed sources configured for each tab
- Your active tab selection
- Category, language, date, and search filters for each tab
- Your settings preferences (selected countries, toast messages setting, subheader collapsed state)

**Note**: Cached news articles are NOT exported (they will be re-fetched automatically when you restore).

#### Importing/Restoring Your Configuration

1. **Go to Settings**: Click the Settings button in the top right
2. **Scroll to Bottom**: Navigate to the "Import/Export" section
3. **Click "Import Configuration"**: This opens a file picker

**What Gets Restored:**

**Important Notes:**
- Importing will **replace** your current configuration. Make sure to export your current setup first if you want to keep it.
- The application supports both the new backup format (v1.0) and the old format (sources only) for backward compatibility.
- After importing, the page will reload to apply all changes.
- If you import a backup that has tabs with sources that no longer exist, those sources will still be restored but may not fetch articles if the RSS feed is unavailable.

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Organize with Tabs**: Create separate tabs for different topics (e.g., "Local News", "Technology", "Sports")

2. **Use Country Filters**: When searching for sources, filter by country to find region-specific news outlets

3. **Category Filtering**: Use categories to focus on specific topics across all your sources

4. **Search Efficiently**: The search bar searches across titles and descriptions, so use specific keywords

5. **Auto-Refresh**: Enable auto-refresh to keep your feed updated automatically, or disable it to save bandwidth

6. **Toast Messages**: Disable toast messages if you find them distracting, or enable them to monitor feed status

7. **Cache Awareness**: Remember that articles are cached. After adding or removing sources, refresh the page to see changes

8. **Tab Management**: Use descriptive tab names and organize them by dragging to match your workflow

9. **Manual Feeds**: You can add any valid RSS feed manually, even if it's not in the pre-configured list

10. **Source URLs**: Click on active sources in Settings to quickly copy their URLs for sharing or backup
