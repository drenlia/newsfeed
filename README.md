## Installation (Docker)

The easiest way to run this application is using Docker. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose V2 installed on your system.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file and set the `HOST` variable:
   - For local development: `HOST=localhost` (default)
   - For production: Set `HOST` to your domain name (e.g., `HOST=news.example.com`)
   
   If you need to allow multiple hosts, use `ALLOWED_HOSTS` instead (comma-separated):
   ```
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=news.example.com,www.example.com
   ```

3. **Build and start the application:**
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the application:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3072
   ```
   (Or use your configured domain if you set HOST to a domain name)

That's it! The application is now running.

## Using the Application

For detailed instructions on all features and options, see the [User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use:**
If port 3072 is already in use, you can change it in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
ports:
  - "YOUR_PORT:3072"
```

**Application won't start:**
- Check that Docker is running: `docker ps`
- View logs: `docker compose logs newsfeed`
- Try rebuilding: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`

**Can't access the application:**
- Make sure the container is running: `docker compose ps`
- Check that port 3072 is not blocked by a firewall
- Try accessing via `http://127.0.0.1:3072`

## Technical Notes

- The application runs on port 3072 by default
- All data (tabs, sources, preferences) is stored in your browser's local storage
- RSS feeds are fetched through a backend proxy to handle CORS restrictions
- The application automatically handles character encoding for international content
